Hello teacher and everybody, My name is Mai Thi Gam.At present, I live in Hanoi and I stydied at FPT PoLyTechnic.
Today, I gonna talk about my Vietnamese.Besides hand gesture in Vietnam, Vietnamese often us the following body language.
Turn slightly head: When paying attention to what you are saying, the opposite person will slightly turn their head to 
the side to hear more clearly.Tilt head: Slightly tilting head indicates that this person is not confident about 
what was said.Nod: When someone agrees with you, they will nod their head while you are speaking
Smile: When someone feels confident and agrees with you, people will laugh at you naturally. 
Smile with the wrinkles around the eyes can also show a person's mood Eyebrow up: When someone has a feeling of anxiety, 
surprise, or fear, they often raise their eyebrow to show the annoyance. Therefore, 
if someone compliments your new hairstyle or new outfit with going the eyebrow up, it cannot be a sincere compliment.
Look directly at the communicator: If the person you are talking to often has a calm, steady, blinking look, 
it's a good sign of success in communication. It is a sign of an honest and trustworthy person listening to you very well.
Eyes look down to avoid looking into other people's eyes: The eye of the person who communicates 
with you usually avoids looking directly at you. It means that he or she may be shy and have done something wrong with you. They feel un
comfortable when communicating with you by the eye.Dilate pupil: When someone's pupil is dilated, they are in a very 
positive state. When they agree with your point of view, when someone suddenly compliments them,
 or when they hear something very impressive from you, their pupils will stretch themselves.
